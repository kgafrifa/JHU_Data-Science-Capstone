# JHU_Data-Science-Capstone

The goal is to display the working with the data and to track a prediction algorithm to help create an app. 
The milestone report is to perform exploratory analysis and the goals for the eventual app and algorithm.
The final report shows how the shiny app was created and its use and a presentation completed to pitch the
product to people. Note that due to the limitation of the assignment most of the data was not used.
